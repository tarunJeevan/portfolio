## **Project Overview**
**The Proving Grounds** is a 3D, first-person, action-adventure game prototype set in a medieval-inspired fantasy world. Developed as part of a Capstone project over eight months, this game combines classic ***RPG mechanics*** with ***story-driven elements*** and emphasizes ***ability progression*** over traditional leveling, combining elements from several of our most favorite games such as *For Honor*, *Kingdom Come Deliverance*, *Dark Souls*, and more. Our five-person team used ***Unreal Engine 5.0*** to build the game, focusing on creating an immersive experience with engaging combat, unique enemies, and a rich narrative.
- **Project Duration**: August 2022 - May 2023
- **Platform**: Unreal Engine 5.0
- **Download Prototype**: [Google Drive](https://bit.ly/3NgceUB)

## **Project Objectives**
The primary objective was to develop a prototype that showcases the game&apos;s core features, including an ability-driven progression system, immersive combat, and unique enemy designs. In doing so, we aimed to provide players with a challenging, skill-based experience.

## **Key Features and Functionality**
### **Core Game Mechanics**
The game prototype is designed around a wave-based combat arena, with enemies that increase in difficulty and variety with each wave. Key elements include:

- **Melee and Ranged Combat**: Players can engage enemies using either melee weapons or ranged weapons, each with distinct mechanics and tactics.
- **Ability Progression**: Instead of traditional leveling, the game emphasizes progression through abilities, giving players control over how they develop their character.
- **Shop and Economy**: Players earn currency from defeating enemies, which can be spent on purchasable weapons, items, and abilities through an in-game shop.

### **My Contributions**
My role focused on system design and development for several of the game&apos;s core systems:
- **Ranged Combat System**: Implemented a dynamic ranged combat system using C++ and Blueprints (Unreal Engine&apos;s visual scripting system), allowing players to engage enemies with different weapon types at different distances.
- **Inventory System**: Developed a functional inventory system that lets players manage their weapons, items, and consumables efficiently.
- **Quest System**: Designed a basic quest system that enables players to accept and complete quests, laying the groundwork for more complex interactions in future iterations.
- **Tutorial Level**: Created a simple tutorial level to introduce players to core mechanics and provide guidance on movement, combat, and item usage.
- **Narrative Development**: Wrote an overarching story and narrative framework, which serves as the foundation for the game&apos;s story-driven elements and overall progression.

### **Technical Implementation**
Using C++ and Unreal Engine&apos;s Blueprint system, I developed several key gameplay systems. Here are images from some of the Blueprints I created for the ranged combat system:

#### Function to equip a bow

#### Function to fire an arrow

This code serves as a basis for the ranged combat system which is used by both the player character as well as enemy NPCs.

## **Challenges and Solutions**
1. **Balancing Combat Difficulty**: Creating combat mechanics that were challenging but fair required constant playtesting and balancing. We addressed this by adjusting enemy attributes and AI behavior incrementally.
2. **Quest Integration**: Time constraints limited our ability to fully integrate the quest system into the prototype. However, the foundational code is in place, providing a flexible framework for future expansion.
3. **User Guidance**: Since complex mechanics can be daunting, I started designing a basic tutorial level to introduce players to the game gradually, enhancing their learning curve for combat and item management. Unfortunately, it wasn't completed in time for our final presentation.

## **Outcome and Future Improvements**
Our efforts culminated in a playable prototype featuring a wave-based combat system, a functional shop and economy, and an introductory tutorial level. Although the prototype remains a work-in-progress, it successfully showcases the game&apos;s potential and highlights our core design objectives.

### **What I Learned**
- **Gameplay Balancing**: Balancing multiple combat styles (melee and ranged) and enemy difficulty was a valuable experience in creating an enjoyable and challenging player experience.
- **Cross-Disciplinary Development**: This project deepened my understanding of how narrative, mechanics, and level design interconnect to form a cohesive game experience.
- **Team Collaboration**: Working in a team highlighted the importance of communication and dividing tasks to make the best use of individual skills.

### **Next Steps**
With additional development time, we would enhance The Proving Grounds by:
- **Expanding the Quest System**: Adding more complex quests and quest lines to deepen gameplay.
- **Enhancing AI**: Improving enemy AI for smarter behavior in combat scenarios.
- **Polishing UI and UX**: Refining the tutorial level and in-game guidance for an even smoother player experience.

## **Conclusion**
Developing The Proving Grounds as a Capstone project was an incredibly rewarding experience. The game prototype demonstrates our team&apos;s dedication to crafting an immersive world with skill-based combat, a thoughtful economy, and a compelling narrative framework. As we move forward, I look forward to seeing how these foundations can be expanded into a full-fledged game.
