## **Introduction**
With heart disease remaining a leading cause of health issues worldwide, early detection and risk prediction are essential for preventive care. I recently collaborated with four talented developers to design and develop an Expert System for Heart Disease Prediction. This system leverages both machine learning and rule-based techniques to analyze patient medical images, assisting individuals in making informed health decisions.

## **Technology Stack**
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, pandas, scikit-learn and more for data processing and machine learning
- **Interface**: Custom GPT for interactive user engagement

We selected Python for its vast libraries and ease of use in machine learning applications. The combination of TensorFlow and scikit-learn provided robust support for training and optimizing our neural network model, while a custom GPT-powered interface enabled intuitive, conversational user interactions.

## **Development Process**
### **Planning and Approach**
Our goal was to create an accessible, data-driven system capable of assessing heart disease risk based on medical imaging. After conducting research on heart disease indicators and machine learning approaches, we identified several core objectives:
1. **Data Preprocessing and Optimization**: Clean and structure large datasets to enhance model training accuracy.
2. **Predictive Model**: Build a neural network capable of handling image-based data to predict heart disease risk.
3. **Interactive Interface**: Develop a user-friendly, GPT-based conversational interface to make the tool approachable for patients.

### **Key Features and Functionality**
#### **Data Preprocessing and Optimization**
The team utilized chest X-ray data from Kaggle, preprocessing the images to ensure they were suitable for machine learning. To improve the model's accuracy, we experimented with various techniques:
- Increasing training samples to expand the dataset,
- Adjusting training epochs to improve learning duration,
- Tuning hyperparameters for model precision.

Our efforts resulted in an F1 score of 0.48, which was a strong outcome given the project timeline.

#### **Predictive Model**
The neural network was built with TensorFlow and designed to classify the likelihood of heart disease risk based on image data. This model gave our expert system predictive capabilities, helping users understand their health risks in a data-supported manner.

#### **Interactive GPT-Based Interface**
A standout feature of this project was the GPT-based user interface, which allowed users to interact with the system through a conversational format. This design choice aimed to put users at ease, creating a supportive environment for discussing their health.

### Code Snippet
Here&apos;s a quick look at how we preprocessed the data:

### **Challenges and Solutions**
- **Image Data Complexity**: Handling large medical image datasets was challenging, especially regarding memory usage. We implemented efficient data handling techniques and optimized processing pipelines to keep the training manageable.
- **Balancing Accuracy and Project Timeline**: Achieving high accuracy for a medical system within a limited timeframe was difficult. We focused on maximizing the F1 score with hyperparameter tuning and iterative training adjustments, finding a balance between performance and feasibility.

## **Outcome**
The project resulted in an accessible, data-driven expert system that enables users to gain valuable insights into their heart disease risk. The system achieved an F1 score of 0.48, an accomplishment given the complexity of the dataset and the timeline.

### **What I Learned**
- **Medical Image Processing**: This project significantly improved my understanding of handling and preprocessing image data in machine learning applications.
- **Neural Network Optimization**: Experimenting with various hyperparameters provided practical insight into optimizing machine learning models for accuracy.
- **User-Centric Design**: Developing a conversational interface reminded me of the importance of empathy in design, especially in health-related applications.

### **What Could Be Improved**
For future iterations, I would:
- Enhance the F1 score by expanding the dataset and experimenting with more complex models.
- Integrate more detailed health metrics and risk factors to provide a well-rounded health assessment.
- Collaborate with healthcare professionals for a more comprehensive and accurate rule-based system.

## **Reflection and Conclusion**
Creating an expert system for heart disease prediction was a challenging yet rewarding project that combined technical depth with user-centered design. By integrating machine learning with a friendly, GPT-powered interface, we delivered a tool that has the potential to make a real difference in health awareness and preventive care.
