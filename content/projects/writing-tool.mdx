## **Project Overview**
The **Online Writing Tool** (name pending review) is a personal project aimed at providing a comprehensive, flexible platform for writers to create, organize, and manage their creative works. Inspired by existing tools such as ***Campfire*** and ***World Anvil***, this tool offers a suite of worldbuilding and writing features that empower users to develop fictional worlds and complex narratives in a streamlined way. Although still under development, several key features have already been implemented, with many more planned.
- **Development Period**: June 2024 - Present
- **GitHub Repository**: [Online Writing Tool Repo](https://github.com/tarunJeevan/writing-tool)

## **Project Objectives**
The primary goal of this project is to provide a robust writing platform that seamlessly combines different tools in a versatile and user-friendly interface. By uniting various writing and worldbuilding features, the Online Writing Tool aims to offer users a centralized workspace that simplifies the often complex processes of worldbuilding and manuscript creation.

## **Key Features and Functionality**
### **Writing and Worldbuilding Tools**
The tool includes an extensive set of features that assist writers at every stage of their creative process. Each tool integrates smoothly with others to maximize flexibility and efficiency, without sacrificing ease of use. Notable features include:
- **Character Creation System**: Allows users to develop detailed character profiles, including personality traits, backgrounds, relationships, abilities, and customizable fields to suit writer preferences or unique characters.

- **Custom Map Builder**: A map creation tool that lets writers create custom maps for their fictional worlds, complete with location markers, labels, and customizable regions.
- **Story Arc Recorder**: This tool assists in tracking character development and story progression, keeping a comprehensive record of arcs and subplots.
- **Timeline Viewer**: The timeline allows writers to structure events chronologically, working with the Story Arc Recorder to visually display various story and character arcs chronologically. 
- **Notes System**: The notes system supports annotations, reminders, and references across different aspects of a project. It's main appeal is the ability to open a note anywhere within the site and attach them to any other tool for future reference.
- **Built-in Wikis**: Writers can create wikis to keep track of lore, world details, magic systems, and other essential background information. These wikis will be easy to update and can even be published by the writer. 
- **Manuscript Text Editor**: A fully-featured text editor that provides formatting options and organizational tools tailored for manuscript writing, supporting drafts, revisions, and final edits. It also supports online collaboration, allowing writers to work simultaneously with editors, proofreaders, or other writers with ease.

### **Interconnectivity and Backend Design**
Each tool is interconnected to allow for a seamless experience. For example, characters and locations can be linked to timelines, and story arcs can reference both. The backend is built with efficient schema design principles to ensure smooth data handling, supporting quick and reliable data creation, update, and deletion operations across all tools.

### **User Authentication and Security**
To protect users&apos; work, the tool includes secure authentication mechanisms that support single sign-on (SSO), magic links, and passkeys. Authentication is handled with NextAuth, ensuring that users&apos; credentials and intellectual property are securely protected.

## **Technology Stack**
### **Frontend and Styling**
- **Framework**: Next.js (TypeScript)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS and Shadcn/UI for a polished, user-friendly design

Next.js provides a fast, scalable foundation, while TailwindCSS and Shadcn/UI facilitate a visually cohesive and responsive interface across devices.

### **Content Management and Authentication**
- **CMS**: Sanity for structured and easily managed content
- **Authentication**: NextAuth for secure and versatile user authentication

### **Database**
The backend design emphasizes scalability and efficiency, particularly for data-heavy worldbuilding projects. Current considerations for user data storage include Firestore, MongoDB, and Pocketbase - flexible, NoSQL databases chosen for their ability to manage complex data relationships and ensure efficient query performance.

## **Development Challenges and Solutions**
1. **Schema and Data Interconnectivity**: Designing the data schema to accommodate interconnected tools while maintaining efficiency required extensive planning. By using a NoSQL database, the backend can store documents in a manner conducive to cross-referencing without compromising performance.
2. **Ensuring Data Security**: Given the sensitivity of creative work, security has been a key priority. With NextAuth and advanced authentication methods like passkeys and SSO, users can be confident their credentials and intellectual property are secure.
3. **User Interface and Usability**: Crafting a UX that keeps each feature accessible yet interconnected was essential for user engagement. TailwindCSS and Shadcn/UI helped achieve a clean, intuitive design while remaining responsive across screen sizes.

## **Future Development Plans**
The project is still in active development, and several enhancements are planned:
- **Advanced Worldbuilding Tools**: Features for detailed location creation, magic system development, and political maps.
- **Collaborative Features**: Shared projects, allowing multiple users to work together in real-time.
- **Data Visualization**: Graphs and diagrams to map out character relationships, plot points, and timelines.

## **Conclusion**
The Online Writing Tool represents an ambitious endeavor to create a centralized platform for fiction writers, offering an expansive toolkit and flexible workspace. By drawing inspiration from established platforms and incorporating custom features, this project aims to cater specifically to the nuanced needs of worldbuilding and creative writing.
