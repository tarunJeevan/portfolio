## Biography

My name is Tarun Jeevan.

I am a passionate and dedicated software developer and educator with a Master&apos;s degree in Computer Science from Purdue University Fort Wayne. I have diverse experience ranging from web development and offensive security to teaching programming and system administration. I aim to leverage my skills to build innovative software solutions and empower others through education.

### Background

From a young age, my family moved around a lot due to my father&apos;s work, sometimes twice or thrice in a single year. Naturally, this made making and keeping friends quite difficult so I turned to books and learning. I&apos;ve never thought of myself as a genius or a prodigy - though my grades at school were definitely among the best - but if there's anything I pride myself on, it's my curiousity and ability to learn. 

My curiousity drove me to read and learn about all sorts of topics - history, psychology, mythology, literature, astronomy, physics, etc. My attention regularly flitted from topic to topic, never staying on any one thing for long. As I grew older and started wondering what I would do with my life and what kind of career I wanted, my high school introduced a new computers class as an elective. There were a number of other options I could have chosen that year. Other elective options included a pre-med class, business class, and more. All of them were interesting and I can no longer remember what made me choose the computers class. Maybe it was being taught by a teacher I liked? Or maybe it was just a whim? Regardless of which it was, that class changed the course of my life as I knew it, in that it helped me finally decide the course of my life. 

## Skills

Over the course of my high school and University career (as a student), I've acquired and developed a number of skills in various fields of interest. 

### *Programming Languages*
I am proficient in C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, Python, Bash. I can use these languages at an Intermediate level and am capable enough to teach them to beginners. 

I am also proficient in using frameworks such as: 
- React.js, Next.js, and ASP.NET Core for Web Development
- TensorFlow and scikit-learn for Machine Learning

Finally, I'm also proficient in using tools such as: 
- Visual Studio, VS Code, and Git/GitHub for Software Development
- Unreal Engine 5.X and Unity for Game Development
- Metasploit, Ghidra, Autopsy, zsteg, BeEF, and more for Cybersecurity

### *Concepts & Knowledge*
While I&apos;m still lacking in practical experience, my conceptual and theoretical knowledge is quite high in a number of areas. 

I am quite familiar and practiced with Cybersecurity concepts such as: 
- The Cyber Kill Chain
- Zero Trust Architecture
- Hashing
- Symmetric and Assymetric Encryption
- Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems
- Stateful and Stateless Firewalls

### *Communication & Teaching*
I worked as both a tutor and an instructor and am skilled in public speaking, active listening, curriculum development, instructional design, student engagement, and cultural competence. 

While these skills were mostly developed in the context of engaging and teaching students, they are transferable to any context requiring positive and constructive interaction with coworkers, superiors, and clients. 

### *Languages*
Languages have always fascinated me, perhaps because I grew up learning and speaking at least 3 languages. Over time, I've developed a mindset that is well suited to learning languages, both human and machine. 

In terms of human languages, I'm fluent in English, Hindi, and Telugu. I also have intermediate level proficiency in German and French, though the former more than the later. In addition to these, I also plan on learning other languages such as Spanish, Japanese, and Russian. 

I'm a regular user of Duolingo, a popular language learning app, and make an effort to watch foreign films and read story books in various languages.
