In my ongoing journey to become a well-rounded developer, I decided to take a step back and revisit .NET development. While I had previously dabbled in **.NET**, I felt it was time to dive deeper into the ecosystem and explore its capabilities more thoroughly. This post will cover my initial steps into the .NET world, including setting up the environment, understanding the MVC framework, and creating a personal finance web application - a recreation of an old project to create a REPL C++ console app to handle my budget. 

## **Setting Up the Environment**
I started by setting up my development environment for .NET. I installed the latest version of the .NET SDK (**.NET 9**) and **Visual Studio**, which provides a powerful IDE for .NET development. I then set up a new project using the ASP.NET Core Web API template to practice building REST APIs in .NET. This template provides a solid foundation for building web applications and APIs, and it helped me get familiar with the project structure and conventions used in .NET development.

I created a simple set of APIs to manage a collection of books. I set up a SQL Server database to store the book data and used Entity Framework Core to interact with the database. This allowed me to practice working with databases in .NET and understand how to perform CRUD operations using Entity Framework. I created Controllers to handle HTTP requests and responses, and I learned how to use dependency injection to manage services and repositories in my application.

I also explored the **Package Manager Console**, which is a powerful tool for managing **NuGet** packages and running migrations in .NET projects. I used it to install necessary packages, such as **Entity Framework Core** and **SQL Server**, and to run migrations to update the database schema.

## **Understanding the MVC Framework**
One of the key concepts in .NET development is the **Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework**. MVC is a design pattern that separates an application into three main components: the *model* (data), the *view* (UI), and the *controller* (logic). This separation of concerns makes it easier to manage and maintain code, especially in larger applications.

I started by watching [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38GNKtclDdE) [few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtiM87MV27w) [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWdCMsLybQU) on the MVC framework in .NET. I learned about the role of each component and how they interact with each other. The model represents the data and business logic, the view is responsible for rendering the UI, and the controller handles user input and coordinates between the model and view. 

I supplemented my learning by reading the [official Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-9.0&tabs=visual-studio) on **ASP.NET Core MVC**, which provided a comprehensive overview of the framework and its features. I also cemented my understanding by building a web application using the MVC pattern.

### **Creating a Personal Finance Web Application**
I started with Visual Studio's ASP.NET Core MVC template to create my personal finance web app - a recreation of an old project to create a command-line REPL program in C++ to handle my budget. I made a fair amount of progress on the C++ app, but I wanted to take it further by building a web application that could be accessed from anywhere.

I created models to represent Expenses and Expense Sheets, views to display that data, and controllers to handle user input and business logic. This helped me understand how the MVC framework works in .NET and how to use it effectively. 

I set up a SQL Server database to store the expense data and used Entity Framework Core to interact with the database. I created a simple UI using Razor views to display the expenses and allow users to create expense sheets and add, edit, and delete expenses.

I also learned about routing in ASP.NET Core MVC, which allows you to define URL patterns and map them to specific controllers and actions. This is essential for building RESTful APIs and web applications in .NET. I implemented routing in my application to handle requests for different resources, such as expenses and expense sheets. This allowed me to create a clean and organized URL structure for my web application.

### AI Assistance
Throughout this process, I utilized AI tools like **GitHub Copilot** to assist me in writing code and generating boilerplate code for my application. Copilot helped me quickly implement features and provided suggestions for best practices in .NET development. It was particularly useful for generating controller actions, model properties, and database queries, allowing me to focus on the overall architecture and functionality of my application.

I also used AI tools to help me understand complex concepts and troubleshoot issues I encountered during development. For example, when I faced challenges with Entity Framework migrations or routing, I could ask AI for explanations or examples, which helped me overcome obstacles more efficiently.

### **Key Learnings**

### **Project Overview**
The personal finance web application I created allows users to manage their expenses and expense sheets. Users can create expense sheets, add expenses, edit existing expenses, and delete expenses as needed. The application provides a simple and intuitive UI for users to interact with their financial data.

The application is structured using the MVC pattern, with models representing the data - Expenses and Expense Sheets - views for displaying the data, and controllers for handling user input and business logic. The application uses Entity Framework Core to interact with a SQL Server database, allowing for persistent storage of expense data.

The project is hosted on GitHub, and you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/tarunJeevan/finance-app). You can clone the repository and run the application locally to see how it works. The project includes detailed documentation on how to set up the environment, run the application, and use the features.

### **Project Structure**
The project is organized into several key components:
- ***Models***: Contains the data models for Expenses and Expense Sheets, which define the structure of the data and relationships between them.
- ***Views***: Contains Razor views for displaying the UI, including pages for listing expenses, creating expense sheets, and adding/editing expenses.
- ***Controllers***: Contains controllers that handle HTTP requests and responses, manage user input, and interact with the models to perform CRUD operations.
- ***Data***: Contains the database context and configuration for Entity Framework Core, which manages the connection to the SQL Server database and performs database operations.
- ***Services***: Contains services that encapsulate business logic and interact with the database using Entity Framework Core. Services are injected into controllers to keep them clean and focused on handling requests.
- ***Migrations***: Contains Entity Framework Core migrations that define changes to the database schema over time. Migrations allow you to update the database structure without losing existing data.
