## **Welcome to My Portfolio!**
Hello, and thank you for visiting my portfolio website! I'm excited to share a bit about myself, my journey in computer science, and the projects I've been working on.

## **Who Am I?**
My name is Tarun Jeevan, and I&apos;m a recent Computer Science graduate with a deep passion for creating and problem-solving through technology. Throughout my academic career and personal projects, I've delved into various aspects of software development, from *full-stack web development* to *game design* and *fiction writing*, blending creativity and technical expertise in everything I build.

Beyond the technical side, I&apos;m also interested in *history* and *mythology*, which often inspires my storytelling and fictional world-building projects. Whether it's working on interactive applications, exploring the latest in programming languages, or designing systems with real-world impact, I find excitement in both the challenges and creative possibilities technology brings.

## **What is This Blog For?**
For the most part, it's a place where I intend to share my thoughts, struggles, accomplishments, and overall journey as a developer and a person. What might that look like? Here are some examples of what I intend to write about:
- **Project highlights**: Detailed write-ups of my latest projects, including the challenges faced, technologies used, and what I learned along the way.
- **Guides and insights**: Simple guides and insights aimed at helping beginners and fellow developers alike, including topics from my teaching experiences.
- **Reflections on tech and beyond**: Thoughts on the tech industry, innovation, and occasionally, musings on how mythology or historical contexts or even current events influence my projects.

## **Conclusion**
I invite you to explore my projects and posts, and if something resonates with you or sparks your curiosity, don&apos;t hesitate to reach out. Whether you&apos;re a fellow developer, potential employer, or just someone with a shared interest, I&apos;d love to connect!

Thank you again for stopping by. Here&apos;s to continuous learning and building creative, meaningful software!
