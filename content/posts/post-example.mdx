## Introduction
Managing personal finances can be a challenge, especially with multiple accounts, subscriptions, and spending categories. To solve this, I created a **Personal Finance Tracker App**. This app allows users to track their income, expenses, and savings in one place, helping them gain control of their financial situation. The project was part of my personal goal to improve financial literacy and was designed for individuals seeking an easy-to-use tool.

## Technology Stack
- **Front-End**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Back-End**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Other Tools**: Chart.js for data visualization, Passport.js for authentication

I chose React.js for its component-based architecture, which allowed for flexible UI development. The back-end was built with Node.js and Express.js due to their simplicity and scalability, while MongoDB offered a schema-less database ideal for tracking dynamic financial data.

## Development Process
### Planning and Approach
The app was designed with user experience in mind, focusing on ease of use. I began by creating wireframes using Figma and worked iteratively based on user feedback. I implemented authentication early on, ensuring user data would be securely stored and accessed.

### Key Features and Functionality
1. **Expense and Income Tracking**: Users can input their financial transactions, categorize them (e.g., groceries, salary), and set budgets.
2. **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts (using Chart.js) allow users to visualize their spending patterns over time.
3. **Savings Goal**: The app includes a feature to set savings goals and track progress.
4. **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS, the app is fully responsive across devices.

**Code Snippet**:
```javascript
const addTransaction = (type, amount, category) => {
  const transaction = { type, amount, category, date: new Date() };
  setTransactions([...transactions, transaction]);
};
```
