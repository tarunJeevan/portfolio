## **What is a Developer Journal?**
A developer journal essentially documents the growth and progress of the software *developer* in addition to the software *application*. 

The format and organization of the journal entries don&apos;t matter as much as the content. In my case, I intend to focus on my discovery and usage of various tools, techniques, libraries, and frameworks. I will also be documenting the development of the project structure and changes in my thought processes as a developer. 

If those are things that sound interesting to you, please follow along!

## **What is an 'Writing and Worldbuilding Tool'?**
This is just the temporary name I gave to this project. I am, unfortunately, quite bad at naming things and didn't want to waste time on figuring out a good name until I was sure this project was going to be viable. 

I plan on renaming it to something more catchy once I&apos;ve achieved my MVP (Minimum Viable Product) goal. In the meantime, if you follow along with these developer journls and come up with a good name, feel free to contact me about it!
