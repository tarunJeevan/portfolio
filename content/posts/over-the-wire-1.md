## **My Journey in the Cybersecurity Field**
Well technically speaking, my journey in the field of cybersecurity began long ago during my undergraduate years. To this day, I still don&apos;t know whether I found the subject interesting myself or if it was my professor who made it so interesting. What I do know is that the cybersecurity-related classes I took were some of the most interesting and memorable of my entire academic career. 

Over time, however, I began leaning more into web development and game development and somewhat neglected my interest in cybersecurity. Recently, that interest has been renewed and I&apos;ve decided to document my re-entry into this field.

To that end, I decided to start by reviewing and expanding my knowledge-base using OverTheWire&apos;s Wargames.

## **Why OverTheWire?**
Based on my research, OverTheWire provides the most entertaining and engaging method of learning and practicing cybersecurity concepts, tools, and techniques.
